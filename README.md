# mozjpegify

I was having some trouble using other people's code to process gigabytes worth of images. Typically it would work for a small quantity of images but would crash when doing massive amounts. Well I made this to easily optimize your images using the mozjpeg encoder. The code is robust and replicates the folder structure to make things easy but since it's doing everything synchronously but it's slow but it gets the job done.
